# bash

Set up a sane bash environment.

`~/.bash_profile` will be linked here. Local overrides should be placed in
`~/.bash_profile.local`

The setup script will try to back up an existing `.bash_profile` to
`.bash_profile.local` (if the local file does not already exist). This makes
migrating existing systems much more seamless.
